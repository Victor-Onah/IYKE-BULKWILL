		description:
			'The BNC connector is used to connect the CCTV camera to the Digital Video Recorder (DVR) via RG59 cable. It is also known as screw-on BNC connector, as it has a screw terminal where the copper core of the RG59 cable is attached to.\nThe BNC connector features two bayonet lugs on the female connector ; mating is fully achieved with a quarter turn of the coupling nut. It uses an outer conductor with slots and some plastic dielectric on each gender connector. This dielectric causes increasing losses at higher frequencies.\nThe BNC coax connector is one of the most widely used RF connectors today. It is very easy and convenient to use, and offers a very high level of performance. The BNC connector is used on test equipment for everything from oscilloscopes to audio generators, and power meters to function generators.\n\nThe BNC connector is used for the transmission of radio frequency signals, including the transmission of analog or digital video signals, antenna connections for ham radio equipment and the connection of avionics and other electronic test equipment.\nBNC terminator absorbs the electrical energy of the signal as it reaches the ends of cable and avoids reflection of signals.\n\nA BNC connector connects the analog video components from the camera to a TV monitor or DVR . It snaps firmly into place, providing for a quality and secure connection.\nThe BNC connector is used to connect the CCTV camera to the Digital Video Recorder (DVR) via RG59 cable. It is also known as screw-on BNC connector, as it has a screw terminal where the copper core of the RG59 cable is attached to.',

		description:
			'V14 Amd Ryzen 3 - 1TB - 8GB RAM - Amd Radeon Graphics. Wins 10 +free Mouse\nAbout\n\nThe Lenovo V14-ADA  is a 14.0-inch laptop with a screen resolution of 220nits. It has 8GB of memory and a 1TB Hard Drive. It has a 1.2GHz processor base speed can turbo boost to 2.9GHz WITH TURBO BOOST SYSTEM\n. It lacks an optical drive for burning CDs or DVDs for its slim and portable build.\n\nIt has 3 full-size USB ports built-in on the laptop. Video outputs include: an HDMI full-size port. It supports WiFi 802.11ac, so it\'s compatible with high-speed routers. It has a 0.3MP webcam for video conferencing. A very slim design for portability no DVD/CD rom\n\nThe Lenovo V14-ADA measures 14.0inches wide by 9.9 inches deep by 1 inches high, and it weighs 3.7 lbs. It\'s backed by a 12-month warranty\nThe Lenovo V14-ADA breaks the mold of the contemporary convertibles. Its design not only capitalizes on a more flattened and sleeker overall surface. It is ultimately a more distinctly commutable gadget to aid users to boot the system up wherever they wish to go. The Lenovo v14 demonstrates a wide range of versatility when it comes to accomplishing essential tasks pertaining to productivity.\nFirst of all, it is worth noting that the monitor of the Lenovo Ideapad  does not flip all the way to the rear end of the device due to the absence of a standard 360 degree angle rotation mechanism. However, it can be laid flat on a plain surface without any obstruction, which can be considered as a quirky trait, which can be put into good use.\n\nWith immediacy, it can also be noted that the Lenovo Ideapad  has a 15.6 inches antiglare display, which is further magnified by thin side bezels. The visuals displayed are further accompanied with an audio system of complimentary caliber all thanks to the appreciated inclusion of Dolby Audio technology.\n\nTherefore, the Lenovo V14 is generally better off to be used and focused on everyday work instead of competitive gaming. The construction of the Lenovo V14 is wholly made out of polycarbonate and plastic materials. This entails to the fact that the structure of the Lenovo Ideapad  is prone to scratch. However, despite the materials used are of the cheaper variety, its aesthetic is surprisingly professional and pleasing to say the least. Needless to say, thoughtful development and efforts were being poured into the design of the Lenovo Ideapad without any sort of visible discrepancy.\n\nLenovo: Lenovo ( "Le" as in the English word legend and "novo" (Latin) for new) was founded in 1984 as a Chinese computer trading company. From 2004, the company has been the largest laptop manufacturer in China and got the fourth largest manufacturer worldwide after the acquisition of IBM\'s PC division in 2005. In addition to desktops and notebooks, the company also produces monitors, projectors, servers, etc.\nIn 2011, Lenovo acquired the majority of Medion AG, a European computer hardware manufacturer.

It also helps prevent fraying or weakening of the cables over time. In addition, the magnetic DC helps guide the plug into the system for a quick and secure connection.\nWhen the connection is secure, an LED located at the head of the DC connector lights up--an amber light lets you know that your notebook is charging, while a green light tells you that you have a full charge. An AC cord is provided with the adapter for maximum cord length, while the AC wall adapter (also provided) gives you an even easier and more compact way to travel.\nDesigned to be the perfect traveling companion, the adapter has a clever design which allows the DC cable to be wound neatly around itself for easy cable storage.\nThis power adapter recharges the lithium polymer battery while the system is off, on, or in sleep mode. It also powers the system if you choose to operate without a battery.',

			'Fake Camera Solar Light] The Solar Security Light looks like a security camera for added realism. Not only does it provide light outside your house, it also scares intruders approaching your house. Provides safe lighting and protection for dark areas of your yard. Please note that it only has the appearance of a security camera and does not have a surveillance function.\n[Motion Sensing Operating Mode] The motion sensor light turns off and charges outdoors during the day and turns on automatically at night when motion is detected. The detection range is 120° and the distance is 16 feet. When motion is detected, the light will illuminate strongly for 20 seconds, then turn to dim illumination for 1 minute, if there is no motion, the light will turn off and the red indicator light will keep flashing as a dummy camera.\n[IP65 Waterproof] The outdoor solar light is made of corrosion resistant ABS material, designed for outdoor use with IP65 waterproof rating, which ensures the light works properly in rain, snow, heat or cold. It can be used in gardens, gates, driveways, porches, patios, etc. to illuminate any dark areas without power.\n[High Efficiency Charging] uses advanced polycrystalline silicon solar panels with a conversion rate of up to 21%. The larger solar panel area allows it to charge faster and last longer. When fully charged, the solar light can be lit approximately 400 times in summer, 300 times in spring and autumn and 200 times in winter. When using it for the first time, please charge it in the sun for at least 8 hours.\nFlexible adjustment] Both the solar panel and the light are adjustable. The solar panel can be adjusted not only up and down, but also left and right to better position it towards the sun. The outdoor motion sensor lights can be adjusted up or down to specify the lighting area so you get a full range of lighting.',
